# FlashCardMaker
Create a set of flash cards for terms and definitions to help study. 

Very basic study aid to be used for studying a class I have this semester
that requires brute memorization. The program reads in a text file that is
written the following format:

    term : definition
    term : definition
    etc.
    .
    .
Simply a term followed by its definition with a colon in the middle. The program
then seperates the terms and defintions, reorders the definitions, and displays one
at a time, along with 4 terms. One of those terms is the correct answer, the others
are not. There are counters of correct and incorrect answers, with a score being 
calcultaed after completion.
